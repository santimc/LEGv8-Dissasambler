# LEGv8-Dissasambler
This is a small static site to practice some javascript and for the course Computer Organization. Must insert the instructions in hex in the input box and the site will calculate the ranges of the instruction and the opcode. [You can see the site here](https://santimc.github.io/LEGv8-Dissasambler/).
